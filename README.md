# **_note-take_**

This is my second Node.js/React project, created as capstone project for Angela Yu's [The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on udemy.

A web app which allows users to add notes and incorporates PostgreSQL database functionality.

Notes, details, comments, docstrings coming soon...
