# **_note-take_**

This is my second Node.js/React project, created as capstone project for Angela Yu's [The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on udemy.

This is a web app which allows users to add notes and incorporates PostgreSQL database functionality.

Lots of work went into creating this project.

I'm really enjoying learning React along with my studies in Python, Data Science, Math $\Rightarrow$ a role in the AI Alignment conversation.

More notes about how I created this project coming soon, just wanted to post the files for now...
